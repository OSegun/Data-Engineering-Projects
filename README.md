## Rental Database
### Project Overview and workflow

A schema organizes data into tables with appropriate attributes, shows the interrelationships between tables and columns, and imposes constraints such as data types. I create and load data into the database, analyze schema design, and use SQL to do analysis on the database. Converting data into a star schema structure, that can be then uploaded to a data warehouse. 

The star schema is an important special case of the snowflake schema, and is more effective for handling simpler queries. The star schema gets its name from the physical model's resemblance to a star shape with a fact table at its center and the dimension tables surrounding it representing the star's points. In this project, I converted the schema into star schema to build a dimension model, and do query analysis.
